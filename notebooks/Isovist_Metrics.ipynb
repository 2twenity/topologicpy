    "An isovist in the context of spatial analysis is the set of all points visible from a particular location in a space, typically described in terms of its geometry. In a 2D environment, an isovist is the visible area that a person can observe from a specific point, considering physical obstructions such as walls or barriers. Several metrics are commonly calculated to analyze and describe the properties of a 2D isovist. These metrics are useful in fields like architecture, urban design, and environmental psychology, as they help understand how visibility influences movement, interaction, and perception in a space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the metrics computed for a 2D isovist. The words in paranthesis is the key string used in the dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Viewpoint (viewpoint)**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: The x, y, z coordinates of the viewpoint from which the visible space is computed.\n",
    "   - **Description**: This metric returns the x,y,z coordinates of the viewpoint from which the visible space is computed.\n",
    "   - **Calculation**: These values are extracted from the input topologic vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Direction (direction)**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: The x, y, z vector direction where the view is directed.\n",
    "   - **Description**: This metric returns the x, y, z vector direction of the isovist.\n",
    "   - **Calculation**: These values are given by the input direction vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Field of View (fov)**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: The horizontal field of view (fov) angle in degrees.\n",
    "   - **Description**: This metric returns the horizontal field of view (fov) angle in degrees.\n",
    "   - **Calculation**: This value is given by the input fov parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Area (area)**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: The area of the isovist is the total size of the visible space from a specific location.\n",
    "   - **Description**: This metric calculates how much space can be seen from a given point, which can be important in understanding how open or enclosed a space feels. A larger isovist area typically implies a more open environment, while a smaller area suggests a more confined or obstructed space.\n",
    "   - **Calculation**: It is calculated as the total area enclosed by the boundary of the isovist polygon.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Perimeter (perimeter)**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: The perimeter of an isovist is the length of the boundary or edge of the visible area.\n",
    "   - **Description**: This metric helps to quantify the complexity or length of the visible boundary. A large, irregular perimeter indicates a more complex boundary with potentially more visual information, while a smooth, simple perimeter might imply fewer visual cues.\n",
    "   - **Calculation**: The perimeter is calculated by summing the lengths of all the edges of the isovist's boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Compactness (compactness)**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Compactness measures how closely the shape of the isovist approximates a circle (the most compact geometric shape).\n",
    "   - **Description**: A more compact isovist suggests a more symmetric and less fragmented visual field, while a less compact isovist indicates a more elongated or irregular shape. This metric can be important in understanding how easily a person can visually navigate the space.\n",
    "   - **Calculation**: It is typically computed using the formula:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     C = \\frac{P^2}{4\\pi A}\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "     where \\( P \\) is the perimeter and \\( A \\) is the area. The closer the value is to 1, the more compact the shape. A value greater than 1 indicates an irregular shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Maximum Visibility Distance (d_max)**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: The maximum visibility distance is the longest straight line that can be seen from the viewpoint without encountering an obstacle.\n",
    "   - **Description**: This metric reflects how far one can see in the space from a given point. It can give an idea of how open or obstructed a space feels in terms of sightlines.\n",
    "   - **Calculation**: It is determined by calculating the longest straight line from the observation point that does not intersect with any boundary or obstruction (e.g., walls or barriers).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Furthest Vertex (v_max)**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: The x, y, z coordinates of the furthest vertex that can be seen from the viewpoint without encountering an obstacle.\n",
    "   - **Description**: This metric reflects how far one can see in the space from a given point. It can give an idea of how open or obstructed a space feels in terms of sightlines.\n",
    "   - **Calculation**: It is determined by calculating the coordinates of the vertex with the largest distance from the viewpoint that does not intersect with any boundary or obstruction (e.g., walls or barriers).\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Visibility Distribution (v_d)**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Visibility distribution quantifies the distribution of visible points across the isovist.\n",
    "   - **Description**: This metric can tell you whether the visibility from a point is more spread out or concentrated in a certain direction. A uniform visibility distribution indicates a more balanced visual field, while a skewed distribution suggests that the observer's line of sight is constrained in certain directions.\n",
    "   - **Calculation**: It is calculated by measuring the angular distribution of visible points or by computing the density of visible locations within sectors of the isovist.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Viewpoint Density (v_density)**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Viewpoint density refers to the number of visible points per unit area within the isovist.\n",
    "   - **Description**: A higher viewpoint density means that the space is more densely populated with visible points, which could indicate a higher degree of visual richness or potential for interaction in that space.\n",
    "   - **Calculation**: It is calculated by dividing the total number of visible points by the area of the isovist:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     VDensity = \\frac{\\text{Number of visible points}}{A}\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "     where \\( A \\) is the area of the isovist.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Isovist Symmetry (symmetry)**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Symmetry measures how balanced or symmetrical the isovist is around the point of observation.\n",
    "   - **Description**: A high symmetry value indicates a balanced visual field in all directions, while low symmetry indicates that the space is more irregular or skewed. Symmetry can influence how a person perceives the space.\n",
    "   - **Calculation**: Symmetry is often calculated using geometric analysis of the isovist's shape. One method is to compute the average deviation from a central symmetry axis or the deviation from a perfect circular form.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Fractal Dimension (d_f)**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: The fractal dimension measures the complexity of the isovist's boundary.\n",
    "   - **Description**: This metric gives insight into how rough or intricate the boundary of the visible area is. A higher fractal dimension typically indicates a more complex and jagged boundary, while a lower fractal dimension suggests a simpler, more regular boundary.\n",
    "   - **Calculation**: The fractal dimension is calculated using methods like box-counting or other fractal analysis techniques, which measure how the boundary detail changes with different scales of observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Edge Complexity (e_c)**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Edge complexity measures how complex the edges of the isovist boundary are.\n",
    "   - **Description**: More complex edges might suggest that the observer's view is influenced by more intricate shapes or features, such as angled walls or multiple obstacles.\n",
    "   - **Calculation**: It is calculated by analyzing the number of corners or the angle changes in the boundary of the isovist. More corners or abrupt changes in direction would indicate higher edge complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Mean Visual Field Angle (theta)**\n",
    "    - **Definition**: This metric measures the average angular extent of the visible area from the observation point.\n",
    "    - **Description**: The mean visual field angle gives a sense of how wide the visual range is around a person, influencing how much of the environment they can see in a given direction.\n",
    "    - **Calculation**: It is calculated by averaging the angular distances between visible boundary points in the isovist. This is typically expressed in degrees.\n"
